The best way learn a new technologie is by practicing, building something with it it's alwasy my favorite way to learn new things, and to day we try to leanrn how to make UI elements, styling in React Native and we pick Instagram UI cloning as a best way since Instgram is built with React Native. we gonna put our hand on Layour with Flexbox, try diffrent method to style the elements, some animations ðŸ˜ƒâœ¨, NavigationðŸ§­ and we are going to start the UI from scratch and without using any UI libraries as we can.

Are You Ready?
Okay make sure you have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in your machine, we alsoneed [`React-native Cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) to bootstrap the a new React Native project. please press the link to install React Native Cli follow and if you don't want to that's totally okay ðŸ¤“. we can use `npx` instead and we won't need to install anything with that.
We can just run the command bellow to boostrap a new React Native project for us:
